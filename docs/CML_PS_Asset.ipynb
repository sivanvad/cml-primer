    "In a typical working day of a data scientist, tackling the business problems requires them going through various stages of machine learning lifecycle. CML plays an important role in simplifying many of the activities in this lifecycle. Depending on the type of user and their requirements, role of CML can vary while supporting complete lifecycle. This demo intends to cover the most common scenarios faced of typical CML user. Intention is to help the audience understand CML capabilities by documenting the journey of a CML user."

    "After identifying data required for the project, data engineers are involved to source data where required to build data pipelines. This is usually performed outside of CML using Cloudera Data Flow (NiFi) or Cloudera Data Engineering (Spark). However, many times it is hard to determine what data is required for this project before hand. Data Scientists have to perform data exploration and work with data teams to identify data that add value to project. This means CML users should have means to access data that is required after acquiring appropriate permissions. SDX plays an important role in enabling this seamless integration between different data services in CDP. With permissions in place, CML users can access data residing in other data services like Cloudera Data Warehouse without relying on data engineers."
